						<h2>LibertyLand is closing down</h2>
						<p>Hello,</p>
						<p>As you may have noticed (or not), LibertyLand is currently on a deep inactivity state and after multiple attempts
						at adding new content to regain user activity we recognize we have failed.</p>
						<p>As such, LibertyLand will be completely closing down on June 13, 2021, this includes the Minecraft server and all 
						of it's remaining gamemodes, the Discord server, and the Forums. Our website will stay up for historical purposes, 
						and to inform about future projects.</p>
						<p>We want to thank every single player that ever joined this server, everyone who spent hours here playing with 
						other people and alone too.</p>
						<p><strong>We will be hosting a last, special event this Friday 11 at 2 PM CDT (7 PM UTC)</strong> 
						and will leave the server online for one day more, after that it will shutdown and we'll upload the 
						Cities world for everyone to download, we would love to have you on this last event.</p>
						<p>Please stay tuned for future announcements in this website and social media accounts 
						(<a href="https://twitter.com/LibertyLandMC">@LibertyLandMC</a> on Twitter) for future projects.</p>
						<p>Sincerely,<br>
						The LibertyLand Administration.</p>
